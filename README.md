# YouTube中文字幕及摘要

[English](README.md) | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

> **This is a fork.** The original project is [zarazhangrui/youtube-digest](https://github.com/zarazhangrui/youtube-digest), MIT licensed, Copyright (c) 2026 Zara Zhang. That copyright and the [LICENSE](LICENSE) are kept intact here. Please report issues with this fork here rather than upstream.
>
> It branches from upstream **v1.1.5** and does not include upstream v1.2.0 (transcript search and universal translation). The two have diverged rather than fallen behind: upstream still translates automatically, while this fork exists specifically to stop that. See [Subtitle translation is manual](#subtitle-translation-is-manual).

Turn every YouTube video into a resource for deep learning. **Chinese subtitles appear on the video itself**, one short phrase at a time and in step with the audio, and the same text is available as a timestamped transcript in a Chrome side panel next to AI overviews, explanations, and notes.

- **Watch with Chinese subtitles drawn over the player.** One button on the video cycles 关 (off), 中 (Chinese), 双 (English above Chinese). It is translated phrase by phrase and stays in time with the audio. This overlay exists only in this fork; upstream has no player subtitles at all.
- **Nothing is translated until you press that button.** Opening the side panel, switching videos, reloading, or scrolling never spends a cent, and a video you translated last week replays from cache instead of being paid for twice. See [Subtitle translation is manual](#subtitle-translation-is-manual).
- Read the same subtitles as a clickable, timestamped transcript in the side panel, in the original language, Chinese, or an aligned bilingual view.
- Build understanding with an AI overview, chapters, key quotes, and selected-text explanations.
- Navigate long videos by clicking timestamps in the transcript, overview, or notes.
- Save polished timestamped notes for later study.
- Keep control of your data with your own API keys, local Chrome storage, and no analytics or telemetry.

YouTube中文字幕及摘要 is a bring-your-own-key project installed locally from GitHub. It is not available through the Chrome Web Store, does not include API credits, and does not run a developer-operated server.

## Install with your coding agent

You do not need to understand the code or use the command line. Send this message to your coding agent:

> Download or clone this project into a permanent folder I choose, tell me its exact full path, and use that same folder for Chrome's Load unpacked step. If I need a suggestion during this first installation, offer `~/Documents/youtube-chinese-subtitles` on macOS or Linux, or `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\youtube-chinese-subtitles` on Windows, but do not assume either path. Walk me through installation and setup in simple terms. https://github.com/zarazhangrui/youtube-digest

Your agent should:

1. Ask where you want to keep the project, download or clone it there, and tell you the exact full path. If you want a suggestion, it can offer `~/Documents/youtube-chinese-subtitles` on macOS or Linux, or `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\youtube-chinese-subtitles` on Windows.
2. Open the official Supadata and DeepSeek pages below and help you create your own accounts.
3. Walk you through selecting the exact project folder you chose in Chrome with **Load unpacked**.
4. Show you where to enter your API keys in the extension's **Settings** page.
5. Open a YouTube video with captions and confirm the transcript and translation work.

Keep this folder in the same place after installation. If you move or delete it, Chrome's unpacked extension stops working until you load the extension again from its new permanent folder.

Never paste an API key into an AI chat, source file, screenshot, or public message. Enter keys yourself, directly in the YouTube中文字幕及摘要 Settings page. Your coding agent can point to the correct field without seeing the key.

## Install manually

If you prefer to do it yourself:

1. Open [github.com/zarazhangrui/youtube-digest](https://github.com/zarazhangrui/youtube-digest).
2. Choose **Code**, then **Download ZIP**.
3. Choose a permanent folder and unzip the project there. Optional suggestions are `~/Documents/youtube-chinese-subtitles` on macOS or Linux, or `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\youtube-chinese-subtitles` on Windows. You may use a different folder.
4. In Chrome, open `chrome://extensions`.
5. Turn on **Developer mode**.
6. Click **Load unpacked**.
7. Select the exact project folder you chose, which must contain `manifest.json`.
8. Pin YouTube中文字幕及摘要 from Chrome's Extensions menu if you want quick access.

Because this is an unpacked extension, it does not update automatically. After downloading an update or changing local files, click **Reload** on the YouTube中文字幕及摘要 card at `chrome://extensions`, then refresh open YouTube tabs. Moving or deleting the source folder breaks the unpacked extension until you load it again from the new location.

## Set up your API keys

YouTube中文字幕及摘要 needs two keys under your own provider accounts:

1. A **Supadata API key** to retrieve YouTube transcripts.
2. A **DeepSeek API key** for overviews, explanations, translation, and automatic note polishing.

### Get a Supadata API key

1. Open the official [Supadata sign-up page](https://dash.supadata.ai/auth/sign-up).
2. Create an account and complete the short onboarding flow.
3. Supadata generates an API key automatically during onboarding.
4. Open the [Supadata dashboard](https://dash.supadata.ai/) whenever you need to find or manage the key.
5. Copy the key and paste it into **Supadata API key** in YouTube中文字幕及摘要 Settings.

See the [official Supadata documentation](https://docs.supadata.ai/) if the dashboard flow changes.

### Get a DeepSeek API key

1. Open the official [DeepSeek API Keys page](https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys).
2. Sign in or create a DeepSeek Platform account when prompted.
3. Choose **Create new API key**, give it a recognizable name such as `YouTube中文字幕及摘要`, and create it.
4. Copy the key immediately. The full key may only be shown once.
5. Paste it into **DeepSeek API key** in YouTube中文字幕及摘要 Settings.
6. If DeepSeek reports insufficient balance, add credit in your DeepSeek Platform account and try again.

See the [official DeepSeek API documentation](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/) for current account and API details.

Open **Settings** from the side panel. You can also open the YouTube中文字幕及摘要 **Options** page from its card at `chrome://extensions` or by right-clicking its toolbar icon. Paste keys only into these Settings fields. Never paste a key into an AI chat, repository file, screenshot, or public message.

The published version supports DeepSeek V4 Flash as its only AI provider:

```text
Base URL: https://api.deepseek.com
Model: deepseek-v4-flash
```

YouTube中文字幕及摘要 sends every DeepSeek request in non-thinking mode for responsive, predictable interactions. The endpoint and model are fixed in Settings, so the only AI credential you enter is your DeepSeek API key. To use another provider or model, copy the safe customization prompt in Settings and give it to a coding agent for your local copy. Never add an API key to that prompt or chat.

Keys and settings are stored in Chrome's local extension storage on your device. Release builds do not include or use `config.js`.

## Use YouTube中文字幕及摘要

1. Open a standard YouTube watch page with captions.
2. Click the YouTube中文字幕及摘要 extension icon to open the side panel. Click it again to close the panel.
3. Read the timestamped transcript.
4. Click the subtitle button on the video player to turn translation on. It cycles **关** (off), **中** (Chinese), **双** (bilingual), and every video starts at **关**. Translation runs only while this button is on, so nothing is translated until you ask for it. The side panel's **Original / 中文 / 双语** row then switches between reading views of what has already been translated. It never starts a translation itself, and **中文** and **双语** stay unavailable until the player has produced something to read.
5. Open **Overview** when you want AI-generated chapters and key quotes.
6. Select transcript text when you want an AI explanation.
7. Save a note from the player or a key quote, then revisit it from **Notes**.

## Subtitle translation is manual

This fork exists to make one guarantee: **DeepSeek is called only after you press the subtitle button on the video player.** Nothing else can spend credit.

Upstream, the side panel translated on its own. Opening it, switching videos, reloading a page, or simply scrolling the transcript could each start a batch of requests, and a cached "currently showing Chinese" flag meant that reopening a video you had read before silently translated it again. Watching a few videos could cost real money without a single deliberate click.

### How it behaves now

**The subtitle button on the player is the only entry point.** This button and the subtitles it draws over the video exist only in this fork; upstream has no player overlay at all. It sits at the top right of the video and cycles:

| Step | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| **关** to **中** | Authorizes translation for this video. Translates the phrase being spoken plus five more. |
| **中** to **双** | Shows English above Chinese. Redraws text you already have; sends nothing. |
| **中** or **双** to **关** | Hides subtitles and stops prefetching. Everything already translated stays cached. |

**Every video starts at 关**, including one you translated last week. Turning it back on replays the cache instead of the provider, so a revisited video costs nothing.

**The side panel never translates.** Its **Original / 中文 / 双语** row switches between reading views of text the panel already holds. **中文** and **双语** stay disabled until the player has produced something to read, and a hint points at the player. Opening the panel, switching videos, following playback, and scrolling the transcript are all free.

**The two switches are independent.** Closing the side panel does not turn off subtitles you enabled on the player, and vice versa. The player keeps translating with the panel closed, because the translation queue lives in the background worker.

**The side panel is manual too.** Click the toolbar icon to open it and click again to close it. It stays open as you move between YouTube videos, and a full browser restart returns it to closed.

### What gets translated, and when

Only the cue being spoken and a five-cue look-ahead, in requests of three cues each. A cue is a short phrase, not a paragraph, so a video you open and abandon costs at most a couple of small calls. Cached cues are never re-sent: the background worker checks the cache when queueing, and again immediately before each request.

### Where the state lives

| State | Stored in | Cleared when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Subtitles, and their Chinese translations | `chrome.storage.local` | After 30 days, or when 20 newer videos push it out |
| Whether you switched subtitles on | `chrome.storage.session` | The browser quits |
| Whether the side panel is open | `chrome.storage.session` | The browser quits |

The persistent cache deliberately stores **no display mode**. Content is remembered; the intent to show it is not. An older cache that still carries one is read as off.

## What works today

- Google Chrome 116 or newer, using the Side Panel API.
- Standard `youtube.com/watch` video pages.
- Native subtitle tracks returned by Supadata. YouTube中文字幕及摘要 prefers English when available, but may show another native language.
- Original, Simplified Chinese, and aligned bilingual transcript views.
- AI overviews, selected-text explanations, translation, and automatic note polishing.
- Local notes and a local cache for recent transcript and digest results.
- DeepSeek V4 Flash for all published AI features. Other providers require a local code adaptation and are not supported by this published version.

Shorts, live streams, private or access-restricted videos, and videos without an available native transcript may not work. Firefox, Safari, mobile browsers, and other Chromium browsers are not currently tested or supported.

YouTube中文字幕及摘要 forces Supadata's `mode=native`. It does not request AI-generated transcripts or perform local audio transcription when native captions are unavailable.

## Supadata free tier and request costs

Current as of August 9, 2026, the [Supadata pricing page](https://supadata.ai/pricing) lists a free tier with **100 credits per month**, no credit card required. Unused credits do not roll over. Supadata pricing can change, so check the current page before relying on these numbers.

The [Supadata transcript documentation](https://docs.supadata.ai/get-transcript) describes the transcript request modes and credit behavior:

- A native transcript request uses **1 credit**, regardless of video duration.
- A generated transcript costs **2 credits per video minute**. YouTube中文字幕及摘要 does not use this path because it forces `mode=native`.
- An unavailable native lookup returned as HTTP `206` still uses **1 credit**.

With the current native-only behavior, the free tier can cover roughly 100 transcript lookups per month when each request succeeds once. Retries and unavailable-caption lookups also consume credits, so actual successful-video coverage can be lower.

DeepSeek usage is separate from Supadata. DeepSeek may apply its own free quota, rate limits, or charges. YouTube中文字幕及摘要 does not collect payments or resell access. Set spending limits and monitor both accounts. The estimate below explains the current DeepSeek translation cost.

## DeepSeek V4 Flash translation cost estimate

Current as of August 10, 2026, DeepSeek lists the following prices per 1 million tokens on its official [pricing page](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/quick_start/pricing/):

- Cache-hit input: **$0.0028 USD**.
- Cache-miss input: **$0.14 USD**.
- Output: **$0.28 USD**.

DeepSeek says these prices may increase soon, so check the current pricing page before relying on this estimate. Its official [token usage guide](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/quick_start/token_usage/) estimates about 0.3 token per English character and about 0.6 token per Chinese character. Its [context caching guide](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/guides/kv_cache/) explains the automatic best-effort disk cache used for repeated prefixes.

A measured 20-minute English talk contained **2,935 spoken English words** and 15,433 transcript characters. With YouTube中文字幕及摘要's current grouping, it became 128 semantic segments and 43 requests of three segments each. Repeated prompts and JSON brought the rendered input to about 108,528 English characters, or **about 32,600 input tokens** using DeepSeek's 0.3 token per English character heuristic. The translated Chinese JSON output is estimated at about 3,500 to 4,500 tokens using the 0.6 token per Chinese character heuristic, plus JSON and ID overhead.

If all input is billed as cache miss, input costs about $0.0046 and output costs about $0.0010 to $0.0013, for a total of about $0.0056 to $0.0059. When much of the repeated system prompt hits DeepSeek's automatic best-effort cache, a realistic lower end is about $0.002 to $0.003. A practical estimate for fully translating this talk is therefore **$0.002 to $0.006 USD, about ¥0.02 to ¥0.04**.

Translation is lazy and progressive, and it starts only when you switch the player's subtitle button on. From then on, only the phrase being spoken and a short look-ahead are translated, in requests of three, and cached segments are reused for free. Opening the side panel, switching videos, reloading, or revisiting a video you already translated costs nothing. Retries, provider behavior, and pricing changes can increase the final cost.

## Remix it with your coding agent

This is a personal remix project. Upstream issues and pull requests are not accepted. If something breaks or you want a new feature, download or fork your own copy and ask your coding agent to fix, remix, or personalize it for you.

YouTube中文字幕及摘要 uses plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with no build step, so it is a friendly starting point for agent-assisted projects. Ideas to try:

- Add more translation languages and let each person choose a learning language.
- Create customized summary templates for lectures, interviews, tutorials, reviews, or research talks.
- Build a vocabulary notebook that saves a word, its sentence, meaning, and video timestamp.
- Export notes and vocabulary to Markdown, CSV, Anki, or another study tool.
- Add personal topic filters that highlight the chapters most relevant to a goal.
- Add optional local-model support for a different privacy and cost tradeoff.
- Improve accessibility with keyboard navigation, font controls, and higher-contrast themes.

Ask your agent to preserve the bring-your-own-key model, keep secrets out of source files, run the checks below, and test the remix on real videos.

If you want another AI provider or model, first open the exact YouTube中文字幕及摘要 project folder that Chrome loaded through **Load unpacked** in your coding agent. Then open YouTube中文字幕及摘要 Settings and use **Copy customization prompt**. Replace the `[PROVIDER]` and `[MODEL]` placeholders before sending it. Do not include any API key in the prompt or chat. After the agent updates your local copy, enter the key yourself in the Settings field it identifies.

## Privacy and data flow

YouTube中文字幕及摘要 makes provider requests directly from the extension:

1. It sends a canonical YouTube watch URL to Supadata to request the native transcript.
2. It sends the transcript and relevant video metadata to DeepSeek when you request AI features.
3. Focused features send only the content they need, such as selected text with context or small transcript batches for translation.
4. It stores keys, settings, notes, and recent cache entries locally in Chrome.

There is no YouTube中文字幕及摘要 account system, advertising, analytics, or telemetry. Supadata and DeepSeek still receive data under their own terms and privacy policies. See [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md) for details.

## Troubleshooting

### The Digest button is missing on a YouTube video

- At `chrome://extensions`, find YouTube中文字幕及摘要 and click **Reload**, then refresh the YouTube tab.
- Confirm that you are on a standard `https://www.youtube.com/watch?...` page, not a Short, embed, or live page.
- The current version automatically follows YouTube when its responsive action bar changes. Wait a moment after the page finishes loading.
- If you have an older downloaded copy, resizing the YouTube window horizontally once may reveal the button. Then download the latest version so resizing is no longer required.
- If it is still missing, ask your coding agent to inspect the content script on that exact video page.

### The side panel does not open

- Confirm that you are on a standard `https://www.youtube.com/watch?...` page.
- At `chrome://extensions`, confirm YouTube中文字幕及摘要 is enabled and click **Reload**.
- Refresh the YouTube tab after reloading the extension.
- Ask your coding agent to inspect the extension if the problem continues.

### YouTube中文字幕及摘要 asks for setup

- Open **Settings** and save both a Supadata key and a DeepSeek key.
- This published version uses the fixed DeepSeek V4 Flash endpoint and model. There are no Base URL or Model fields to configure.
- If Settings says a legacy custom provider was removed, enter a DeepSeek key. The old AI key was cleared so it could not be reused with the wrong service.

### No transcript is found

- Confirm the video is public and has native captions.
- Check your Supadata key, remaining credits, rate limit, and account status.
- Remember that unavailable native lookups and manual retries may still consume credits.

YouTube中文字幕及摘要 will not fall back to generated transcription.

### AI requests fail

- A `401` or `403` usually means the DeepSeek key or account access is invalid.
- A `429` usually means a DeepSeek rate or spending limit was reached.
- Confirm the key was created in the DeepSeek Platform account linked above and that the account has available credit.
- If you adapted a local copy for another model, use the Settings customization prompt again and ask your coding agent to inspect that local implementation.

Never share API keys, private transcripts, or personal notes in chats, screenshots, or logs.

## Checks for coding agents

Ask your coding agent to run these commands after changing the project:

```bash
npm test
npm run check
npm run package
```

The agent should also reload the unpacked extension in Chrome and test several real YouTube videos. Automated checks do not prove that live provider requests and YouTube interactions work.
